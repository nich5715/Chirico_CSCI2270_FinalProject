Assignment: Final Project
Due:	      Phase 1: April 19th, 5pm
            Phase 2: April 26th, 5pm
            Phase 3: May 3, 5pm
      
  In the course outline of our class, stated is what topics we would be covering this past semester.  Lists, queues, stacks, hash tables, and trees.  Also covered were trade-offs, memory allocation, and many other topics.  What I will be doing is creating a main file that calls quizzes, and creates an interactive learning program for these topics attached to a class file to store the expressions and function prototypes of:

--Pointers, memory, classes, and structs
--Linked Lists, single and double
--Stacks and queues
--Trees and heaps
--Hash Tables and Dictionaries
--Searching, sorting, and alogarithmic complexity

  Each section above are divided lectures that we have covered.  These will be the choices in the main menu of the program.  When a user selects an option, they effectively open that specific topic's header and source files.  
  This choice the user inputs, specifies what functions will be run through a do-while loop.  When a choice is activated, it will start a program to quiz the user on his/her knowledge on that subject.  Within each topic, there will be function calls to sub-sections within those sections that cover topics of similar roots. Within each of the forementioned topics above, a quiz tally will be kept to keep track of your score within each section as you pass through.  It will have a percentage and possibly a function to tell the user where his/her weaknesses are/what to improve on.  
  There will be a few different types of quizzes. Some will be True/False, some will look at code snippets and as which one is correct for this or that, and some will be a quiz with a word bank.  The score of each quiz will be stored inside a Binary Tree that will be designated for that specific section of that specific topic.
  Of course, given the limited time available, I am going to begin with the most recent information we covered in Data Structures First.  Then progress to earlier sections when creating each header and source file.
